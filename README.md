### To deploy MacOS Sierra on a Volumes, have to do it in macOS Sierra
### The installation time is about 15 minutes depending on the speed of your disk and your system.

### The second part of the program will be done on the new volume that will be deployed, 
### This will last about 2 minutes with Apple's startosinstall tools which is integrated into Install macOS High Sierra.app.
### Since Sierra 10.12.3 Apple has changed the tools and it is no longer possible to do so on a selective volume. Have to do it on the Main Disk, that's why we created our disk Main in the first part.
